## 2. Team Requirements

Our team is responsible for the **Visual Effect System** — all non-audio visual feedback in the game, including particle effects, color treatments, background art, UI iconography, and menu/homepage layout. Our goal is to make gameplay feel more dynamic and readable, and to give the game a cohesive visual identity across all screens.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

1. **Explosion Particles**
*1.1 Enemy Explosion*
• Display an explosion at the enemy's exact position when it is destroyed.
• Generate 10–15 small particles that spread in different directions.
• Use orange, yellow, and red particles.
• Make the particles disappear within 0.5 seconds.
*1.2 Player Explosion*
• Trigger a larger explosion when the player's spaceship is destroyed.
• Generate 20–30 particles spreading outward.
• Display the explosion for approximately 1 second.
• Remove all particles after the animation ends.

2. **Color System** 
*2.1 Game Color Palette*
• Define a shared color palette for the entire game.
• Use dark blue or black for backgrounds.
• Use red and orange for damage and explosions.
• Use green or blue for positive effects and power-ups.
• Store color definitions in one reusable location.
*2.2 Player Damage Feedback*
• Make the player's spaceship flash red immediately after taking damage.
• Alternate between its normal appearance and red for 0.5 seconds.
• Restore the original appearance automatically.
*2.3 Power-Up Highlight*
• Add a colored glow around active power-ups.
• Use different colors to distinguish different power-up types.
• Remove the glow when the power-up expires.

3. **Background Effects**
*3.1 Dynamic Background*
• Replace the plain black background with a moving starfield.
• Use multiple layers of stars moving at different speeds to create a sense of depth.
• Keep the background moving during menus and countdowns, not just active gameplay.
• Make the background feel slightly more intense on higher levels to reinforce rising difficulty.
• Example: the background is calm and slow on early levels, and noticeably faster and busier on later, harder levels.

4. **Icon Set**
*4.1 UI Icons*
• Design a small icon for the score display instead of using plain text alone.
• Design a distinct life/heart icon separate from the player's ship sprite, so the HUD doesn't reuse gameplay art.
• Design an icon for the currency/coin system.
• Design icons for pause and settings functions.
• Example: the score in the corner shows a small coin or star icon next to the number, and lives are shown as heart icons instead of tiny ship copies.

## 4. Dependencies on Other Teams

1. **Sound Effects/BGM Team** — Need audio cues synced to our visual effects (e.g., explosion sound timed with particle burst) for combined feedback.
2. **Gameplay HUD Team** — Need event triggers/hooks (e.g., damage taken, score change) so our visual effects can fire at the correct moments.
3. **Player & Enemy Ship Variety Team** — Need finalized ship sprites/states so we can apply visual effects (e.g., explosions, damage flashes) accurately to each ship type.
