Our team is responsible for implementing the Gameplay HUD system.

The HUD should provide players with important game information clearly and update the displayed information during gameplay.

## Detailed Requirements

1. **Score Display**
   - Maintain the existing score display.
   - Ensure that the displayed score reflects changes to the player's score during gameplay.
   - Improve the readability or layout of the score display when necessary.

2. **Lives Display**
   - Maintain the existing lives information displayed during gameplay.
   - Ensure that the HUD correctly reflects changes in the player's remaining lives.
   - Avoid redundant or unclear presentation of lives information.

3. **Level / Stage Display**
   - Display the current level or stage when the required information is available.
   - Update the displayed level or stage when game progression changes.

4. **Currency Display**
   - Display the player's current currency balance when the Currency System provides the required information.
   - Update the displayed balance when the currency value changes.

5. **Game Status Display**
   - Display useful game-state information when appropriate.
   - Possible status information may include level transitions, game over state, or other gameplay states supported by the game.

6. **Clear and Non-Intrusive HUD Layout**
   - Arrange HUD elements so that important information is easy to read.
   - HUD elements should not cover or interfere with important gameplay areas.

7. **Reuse Existing Game Data**
